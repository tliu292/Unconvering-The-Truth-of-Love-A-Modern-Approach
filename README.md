## Abstract
As machine learning becomes a truly hot topic these days, people use it to do lots of things, from gaming to stock trading. Even for those typical "human-only" fields such as painting and composing, people started doing research and tried to use machine learning to "replace" humans. This paper focuses on using naive machine learning approaches on dating and looking for soul mates, which is even more humanized. By trying different models, including Logistics Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with some model selection tricks, the best model is selected to predict if a pair of people will match after their first speed dating. This project is based on a data set from an experiment conducted by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar.

## Contributions
For the data pre-processing, Tz-Ruei mainly worked on the data cleaning and the preparation for the diff approach, while Feiyu and Kyle managed the preparation for the concat approach. Then, for the experiment, Tz-Ruei was in charge of testing the Logistic Regression approach, Kyle was in charge of the Random Forest approach, and Feiyu worked on the Support-Vector Machine. For the presentation, each person made the slides about what they had done, so was this paper.
